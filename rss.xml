<title>Detecting similar and identical images using perseptual hashes</title>
<link>http://hackerlabs.org/blog/2012/07/30/organizing-photos-with-duplicate-and-similarity-checking</link>
<description><![CDATA[Use a perseptual hashing algorithm (pHash) to create an image signature that can be used to detect similar and identical images. Compare pHash against other duplicate detection algorithms like color histograms, average hashing, multi-resolution Haar wavelet decomposition etc. Finally, build a tool that can organize photos based on their (EXIF) creation date, but skips/marks identical images using pHash signature.]]></description>

<title>God's number is 20, mine is 67.</title>
<link>http://hackerlabs.org/blog/2011/06/16/gods-number-is-20-mine-is-67-2</link>
<description><![CDATA[The term "God's number" is the minimum number of turns required to solve a Rubik's cube from an arbitrary starting position (i.e., in the worst case). Rokicki et al. (2010) used a Google supercomputer and 35 CPU-years to determine God's number to be 20. Without using magic or trickery, the best I can do is 67. Learn one of the most common algorithms to solve the Rubik's cube.]]></description>
